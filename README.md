## Problem 1 – Least Common Multiple (LCM) using Recursion
**File:** `problem1.py`

This program computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two positive integers using recursion.  
- It first defines a recursive **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** function.  
- The LCM is then calculated using the formula:  

\[
LCM(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCD(a, b)}
\]

- The program checks that the inputs are positive and non-zero before proceeding.

## Problem 2 – Bubble Sort with Step-by-Step Comparison
**File:** `problem2.py`

This program implements **Bubble Sort** with detailed logs showing each comparison and swap.  
- The user enters numbers separated by spaces.  
- The program compares items pair by pair, swapping when necessary.  
- It prints each iteration until the list is sorted.  

This helps visualize how Bubble Sort works step by step.
