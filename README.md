This repository contains solutions for two problems using Python.

## Problem 1 â€“ Least Common Multiple (LCM) using Recursion
**File:** `problem1.py`

This program computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two positive integers using recursion.  
- It first defines a recursive **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)** function.  
- The LCM is then calculated using the formula:  

\[
LCM(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{GCD(a, b)}
\]

- The program checks that the inputs are positive and non-zero before proceeding.

## Problem 2: Sorting with Step-by-Step Output
**File:** `problem2.py`

The second program demonstrates sorting using **Bubble Sort**.  
- The user inputs a list of numbers.  
- The program shows each comparison, swap, and iteration until the list is sorted.  

**Sample Run:**
